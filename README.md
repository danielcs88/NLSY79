# Project: National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979

## An Analysis on the effects of characteristics on Unemployment.

Using the data from the [National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979](https://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy79.htm).

My hypothesis is that these variables will provide a broader and more robust picture of which Americans go through struggles or which Americans' conditions are resilient to unemployment.

I will attempt to find the underlying importance of certain exogenous variables to explain key endogenous variables using logistic regression.

### Exogenous variables

- Age
- Race
- Sex
- Math ASVAB score
- Word ASVAB score
- College Major
- Highest Degree Received
- Occupation
- Class of Worker
- Firm Size (that one works at, or owns)
- Income
- Region
- Marital Status
- Urban or Rural Household

### Endogenous Variables

- Unemployed for a period in 2016

### ASVAB

> The **Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery** (**ASVAB**) is a multiple
> choice test, administered by the United States Military Entrance Processing
> Command, used to determine qualification for enlistment in the United States
> Armed Forces. It is often offered to U.S. high school students when they are
> in the 10th, 11th and 12th grade, though anyone eligible for enlistment may
> take it.

## OLS Regression Analysis on Income

Additionally, I will study what variables influence income for these subjects using Ordinary Least Squares.
